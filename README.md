# 搬新家~~~
Have fun with 367 programs!

# A. How to upload:
0. Pull the changes (yellow cloud with green, L-shaped arrow) so that you are working on the latest version
1. Make any changes you want (be careful when deleting files)
2. Add to index (green "+" sign)
3. Commit & push (yellow cylinder with red arrow)

# B. If [non-fast-forward] occurs, that means you are working on an old version. To solve this:
0. Pull the changes as in A (now you have the latest version)
1. Make any edit you want (and resolve confilicts)
2. Add to index and commit as in A
3. Grab a cup of coffee and enjoy
